    <p><strong>Bread</strong>, regardless of the exact location, was, and always will be a staple of any European cuisine. This fact of life was true for the Vikings, just as it was true for their continental contemporaries.
    </p>
    <p>That being said, their nomadic lifestyles paired with the harsh tundra climate meant some adjustments had to be made. The following is a flatbread recipe which compliments just about any other recipe on the website.
    </p>
    <p>First, prepare the following ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>1 tps of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Vikings seldom had access to any type of oven, which means you won't be needing one either! Simply follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt</li>
        <li>Once thoroughly mixed, gradually begin adding the water while stirring. Soon, you'll have made a soft dough, which you should knead until it becomes smooth</li>
        <li>Divide the smooth dough into 6-8 pieces, and roll each one out into a thin, round flatbread</li>
        <li>Heat a dry frying pan over medium heat. Next, individually cook the flatbreads for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown</li>
        <li>Serve warm, perhaps alongisde another dish?</li>
    </ol>
