    <p>As it turns out, being trapped in a Tundra environment motivates even the battle-hungry Vikings of yore to <em>experiment</em> with their dietary options.
    </p>
    <p>Although the overwhelming majority of these culinary revolutions have (presumably) resulted in catastrophic results, it's thanks to these brave souls that in the modern day, we know pork and apples go well together.
    </p>
    <p>I'd like to challenge you, the reader, to give this recipe a shot. Deceptively simple, deceptively <strong>delicious</strong>, and deceptively easy to make. Start with the following ingredients:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 apples, cut into eighths. Tart apples are always the best fit - Granny Smith, Pink Lady, etc.</li>
        <li>2 onions, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>8 slices of smoked pork belly</li>
        <li>Small portion of butter</li>
        <li>4 sprigs of fresh thyme</li>
        <li>2 tsp of dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 healthy tablespoon of honey</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps to prepare Æbleflæsk</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a frying pan, and cook the pork belly until golden brown. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Remove the pork, and add fresh thyme into the butter mixture. Use the butter to sweat your onions for a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the onions have softened,introduce your apples into the pan. Cook for 10-15 minutes, until your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Add a dollop of honey and a sprinkle of salt to glaze the apples. Be <strong>careful</strong> not to burn the fruit.</li>
        <li>Once the apples have developed a healthy sheen, serve alongside pork, and perhaps some <a href="./viking-flatbread.html" flatbread></a> </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Bon Appétit!</h3>
