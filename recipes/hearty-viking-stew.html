    <p>Back in the Viking Age, food had to fulfill two purposes: it had to be <strong>easy</strong> to make, and it had to <strong>warm</strong> you up.
    </p>
    <p>This authentic Viking Stew fulfills both those requirements, and as an added bonus, is just as easy to make in your kitchen, as it was to prepare in the Scandinavian tundra.
    </p>
    <p>To start, you'll need a handful of ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb beef or venison, cubed</li>
        <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
        <li>3 carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>2 parsnips, chopped</li>
        <li>2 turnips, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cups of beef broth</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried sage</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried rosemary</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As you may have noticed, all of the ingredients were readily available even during the Scandinavian winters, some 1200 years ago.
    </p>
    <p>Gathering some meat and root vegetables was <em>almost</em> as easy as cooking them into a stew will be, so long as you follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, melt down the butter over medium heat. Add the onions, and cook until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the meat of choice, and cook until the cubes have been browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Stir in the carrots, parsnips, turnips, salt, pepper, thyme, sage, and rosemary.</li>
        <li>Once the flavors have gotten too know each other, pour in the beef broth, bring to a boil. Once you do, reduce the heat, and let it simmer for 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li>Once the meat has softened, serve hot with a side of <a href=viking-flatbread.html target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking flatbread</a>, or rustic rye bread.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Bon App√©tit!</h3>
